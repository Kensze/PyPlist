# PyPlist
PyPlist is a command line utility written in Python that takes video playlists as input and concatenates them. Perfect if you have alot of conference talks and can't decide which one to watch.
### Running PyPlist
```sh
$ python3 PyPlist.py
```
You will then have a new playlist called outputList.pls in the current directory.
